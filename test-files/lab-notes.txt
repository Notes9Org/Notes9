Lab Notes - Experiment Day 5
=============================

Date: January 15, 2025
Researcher: Dr. Sarah Chen
Project: Protein Crystallization Study

Observations:
-------------
Today marked significant progress in crystal growth. Visual inspection 
under the microscope revealed well-formed hexagonal crystals in wells 
C4, C5, and D3.

Crystal Characteristics:
- Size: 100-150 micrometers
- Shape: Hexagonal plates
- Clarity: Excellent transparency
- Color: Colorless

Environmental Conditions:
- Temperature: 20.1°C (stable)
- Humidity: 45%
- Incubation time: 120 hours

Concerns:
- Well A1 shows no crystal formation
- Well B2 has precipitate (no crystals)
- Consider adjusting pH in next batch

Action Items:
1. Image crystals using polarized light
2. Measure exact dimensions for diffraction suitability
3. Prepare cryoprotection buffer
4. Schedule X-ray beam time

Next Steps:
Continue monitoring for 9 more days. Target crystal size is 200-300 μm 
for optimal diffraction quality.

Notes:
------
Protocol working well. Team meeting scheduled for Friday to discuss 
results and plan next experiments.
